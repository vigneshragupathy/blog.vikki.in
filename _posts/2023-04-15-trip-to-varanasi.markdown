## Summary

On March 2023, my colleague Ajay and I embarked on an epic road trip from Bangalore to Varanasi.

Just two weeks before the trip, we made the spontaneous decision where we could work remotely from any location.

We both took turns driving the car, allowing one of us to work while the other drove. Since we had meetings mostly at night, we would stop a bit earlier in the evening and attend the meetings from our hotel.

It was a unique experience to combine work and travel, and we enjoyed every moment of our trip.

## The plan

## Day-1: Bangalore to Hyderabad

We started from Bangalore on Saturday Morning.

Our first stop was Hyderabad where we stayed at "The Peerless Inn". We couldn't resist trying the famous Hyderabadi dum biryani from "Pista House", and it did not disappoint.

Unfortunately, Ajay accidentally paid ~500 INR to a previous tea shop owner when paying via UPI, and despite trying to reach the owner, he did not get his money back.

## Day-2: Hyderabad to Nagpur

We started from Hyderabad on Sunday morning.

we stopped at "Konaseema vantillu" for breakfast. The food was delicious, and the service was excellent. Parking was a bit of a challenge, but we managed to find a spot.
We took a unlimited breakfast buffet, and we were stuffed by the end of it.

The road from Hyderabad to Nagpur was bone-dry and hotter than a kettle on the boil! We decided to stop for lunch at a Rajasthani veg dhaba and I started to feel sick after eating it.

Ajay had the wheel for the better part of the day, while I had a pounding headache, likely due to the combination of the hot weather and the lackluster food. I popped some pills and managed to doze off in the car for a bit.

After crossing Nagpur, we finally reached "Hotel Sai Residency" in the dark.

The following day, Ajay made sure his car was spick and span for the next leg of our journey.

### Day-3: Nagpur to Varanasi

On Monday morning, we departed from Seoni and arrived in Varanasi late at night, exhausted from the long drive. 

To ensure a comfortable stay, we opted for the pricey yet luxurious accommodations at "Hotel Om Vilas Beneres." A good night's sleep was all we needed after such a tiring journey.

Beautiful view from the hotel.

## Day-4: Varanasi

### Kashi Vishwanath temple

In our Varanasi trip, one of the main attractions we were eager to visit was the Kashi Vishwanath temple. 

To make the most of our day, we decided to start our morning early and arranged for a cab through our hotel, Hotel Om Vilas Beneres. 

The driver was incredibly friendly and even helped us to obtain tickets to the temple. 

Thanks to his assistance, we were able to navigate our way through the crowds and enjoy the beauty and spiritual significance of the temple.

### Saranath

We decided to visit Saranath after our visit to the Kashi Vishwanath temple. 

The place was incredibly peaceful and serene, and we hired a guide to show us around and explain the history and significance of the place.

With our desire to buy some Banaras silk, we made it clear to the guide not to take us to any shop and pressure us into making purchases. 

Nonetheless, the guide took us to a nearby shop where we indulged in the exquisite Banaras silk.

### Ganga Yatra

When visiting Varanasi, one must not miss the Ganga Yatra. So, in the evening, we planned to visit the famous attraction and decided to book a cab via Ola instead of using our own car. 

We reached the ghat and hired a private boat for around 45 minutes to explore all the ghats in Ganga. 

The boat guide was extremely knowledgeable and showed us around all the famous ghats. 

He also ensured that we got a front seat to view the famous Ganga Yatra. T

he whole experience was mesmerizing, and we enjoyed every bit of it. 

It was undoubtedly the best part of our trip to Varanasi. We clicked lots of pictures to cherish these memories forever.
